## 📌 What is Machine Learning (ML)?

ML is a subset of AI that enables systems to **learn patterns from data** without being explicitly programmed.

## 📌 Types of Machine Learning

### **1. Supervised Learning**

- Input + labeled output
    
- Algorithms: Linear Regression, SVM, Random Forest
    

### **2. Unsupervised Learning**

- Only input data, no labels
    
- Algorithms: K-Means, PCA
    

### **3. Reinforcement Learning**

- Agent learns by interacting with environment

## 📌 What is Deep Learning (DL)?

DL uses **neural networks with many layers** to learn complex patterns.

Examples:

- CNNs (images)
    
- RNNs / LSTMs (text)
    
- Transformers (NLP, GPT models)

## 📌 Differences:

|ML|DL|
|---|---|
|Feature engineering required|Learns features automatically|
|Small datasets|Needs large datasets|
|Faster|Computationally heavy|
