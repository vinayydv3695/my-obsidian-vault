## ## 1. Overview of Relational Databases (RDBMS)

Relational databases store data in a **structured, table-based format**.

### **Key Concepts**

- **Table:** A structured collection of rows and columns.
    
- **Row (Record):** A single entry/tuple in a table.
    
- **Column (Attribute):** A specific data field in a table.
    
- **Primary Key:** A unique identifier for each row.
    
- **Foreign Key:** A reference to a primary key in another table (supports relationships).
    

### **Example Schema**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Position VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Sales (
    SaleID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EmployeeID INT,
    Product VARCHAR(100),
    Amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeID) REFERENCES Employee(EmployeeID)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### **Characteristics**

- Strict schema.
    
- Supports JOIN operations.
    
- Strong consistency through ACID properties.
    
- Best suited for structured and predictable data.

## ## 2. NoSQL Database — Introduction

**NoSQL = Not Only SQL**.

A NoSQL database is a **non-relational**, **schema-flexible**, and **highly scalable** data storage system.

### **Definition**

According to Wikipedia (from the slide):  
NoSQL databases:

- Store data in forms other than tables (e.g., **document, key-value, columnar, graph**).
    
- Allow **schema-less** or **dynamic schema** design.
    
- Handle large volumes of **semi-structured or unstructured** data.
    
- Are optimized for **scalability**, often using distributed architecture.
    
- May support **SQL-like query languages** but are not relational.

## ## 3. NoSQL Data Representation (MongoDB Example)

MongoDB stores data as **documents** in JSON-like format.

### Example Document

```json
{
  "_id": 1,
  "name": "Alice",
  "position": "Manager",
  "sales": [
    { "sale_id": 101, "product": "Laptop", "amount": 800 },
    { "sale_id": 103, "product": "Keyboard", "amount": 50 }
  ]
}
```

### Observations

- **Embedded documents** (sales array) remove the need for joins.
    
- **Flexible structure**—fields can vary between documents.
    
- Ideal for hierarchical or nested data.

## ## 4. Relational vs NoSQL Databases

| Feature        | RDBMS                      | NoSQL                                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Data Model     | Tables (rows/columns)      | Documents, key-value, graph, column       |
| Schema         | Fixed schema               | Schema-less / dynamic                     |
| Scaling        | Vertical scaling           | Horizontal scaling (sharding)             |
| Query Language | SQL                        | Varies (JSON queries, CQL, Gremlin, etc.) |
| Relationships  | Strong, structured (joins) | Typically denormalized                    |
| Consistency    | Strong (ACID)              | Often eventual consistency (BASE)         |

## ## 5. Types of NoSQL Databases

There are **four major categories**:

### ### 1. Document-Based Databases

- Store data as **documents** (JSON, BSON, XML).
    
- Example: **MongoDB, CouchDB**.
    
- Good for **hierarchical** and **semi-structured** data.
    

### ### 2. Key-Value Stores

- Store everything as **key-value pairs**.
    
- Very fast for lookups.
    
- Example: **Redis, Riak, DynamoDB**.
    
- Use cases: caching, session storage.
    

### ### 3. Column-Oriented Databases (Wide Column Stores)

- Store data in **columns** instead of rows.
    
- Optimized for analytical queries and large datasets.
    
- Example: **Cassandra, HBase**.
    

### ### 4. Graph-Based Databases

- Use **nodes**, **edges**, and **properties**.
    
- Best for highly connected data like social networks.
    
- Example: **Neo4j, Amazon Neptune**.

## ## 6. Why NoSQL?

NoSQL databases were introduced to overcome the limitations of relational databases in the modern era.

### **Reasons**

- Need for **massive scalability** and distributed systems.
    
- Ability to handle **big data**, unstructured or semi-structured data.
    
- Faster development due to schema flexibility.
    
- Better performance for specific workloads (e.g., real-time analytics).

## ## 7. ACID vs BASE

### ### ACID (Used by RDBMS)

1. **Atomicity:** Transaction is all-or-nothing.
    
2. **Consistency:** Database must remain in a valid state.
    
3. **Isolation:** Transactions must not interfere with each other.
    
4. **Durability:** Data survives crashes or restarts.
    

### ### BASE (Used by NoSQL)

1. **Basic Availability:** System guarantees availability.
    
2. **Soft State:** Data may change over time without input.
    
3. **Eventual Consistency:** System becomes consistent eventually.
    

### **Key Idea:**

**RDBMS emphasizes safety (ACID)**,  
**NoSQL emphasizes scalability (BASE)**.

Although the slide does not give specific cases, typical comparisons include:

|Scenario|Best Choice|
|---|---|
|Large-scale unstructured data|NoSQL|
|Banking, financial transactions|RDBMS|
|Real-time analytics|NoSQL|
|Inventory, ERP, CRM|RDBMS|
|Social media, recommendation systems|Graph NoSQL|
