# ## 1. What is Graph Data Modeling?

Graph Data Modeling is the process of designing **how data is represented in a graph database**.

### **Key Concepts**

- Involves **nodes (entities)** and **relationships (connections)**.
    
- Schema is **flexible**, unlike RDBMS.
    
- Easily adaptable to evolving business requirements.
    

---

# ## 2. Types of Graph Models

There are two major kinds of graph models:

### **1. Data Model (Schema Model)**

Defines:

- Types of nodes
    
- Types of relationships
    
- Properties on nodes/relationships
    

**Example Schema:**

- Node labels: `(:Student)`, `(:College)`
    
- Relationship: `(:Student)-[:JOINED]->(:College)`
    
- Properties:
    
    - Student: `{name, age}`
        

### **2. Instance Model**

Represents the **actual stored data**.

**Example:**

```
(:Person {name: "Ajay", age: 18})
(:College {name: "NCU"})
(:Person {name: "Ajay", age: 22})-[:JOINED]->(:College {name: "NCU"})
```

# ## 3. Steps in Graph Data Modeling

1. **Understand the domain**  
    Identify stakeholders, use cases, data flows.
    
2. **Develop initial graph model**  
    Nodes + relationships.
    
3. **Validate model using Cypher queries**  
    Ensure all use cases can be answered.
    
4. **Create instance model with sample data**  
    Test early.
    
5. **Refactor the model**  
    Modify nodes/relationships/properties as use cases evolve.

# ## 4. Domain Example: Student Management System

### **Nodes (Entities)**

- Student
    
- Professor
    
- Course
    
- Department
    

### **Relationships**

- Student → **ENROLLED_IN** → Course
    
- Professor → **TEACHES** → Course
    
- Department → **OFFERS** → Course
    

### **Properties**

- Student: `name`, `studentId`, `birthDate`
    
- Course: `courseId`, `title`, `credits`
    
- Professor: `name`, `employeeId`, `specialization`
    

---

# ## 5. Use Cases in Student System

- Which courses is a student enrolled in?
    
- Which professor teaches a given course?
    
- How many students are enrolled in a course?
    
- Who are a student's classmates?
    
- Which students received top grades?
    
- What is the most popular course?
    
- Who is the youngest student in a department?
    

---

# ## 6. Refining the Model

Graph models evolve easily.

### **New Nodes**

- Semester
    
- Exam
    
- LibraryBook
    

### **New Relationships**

- Student → **TOOK_EXAM** → Exam
    
- Student → **BORROWED** → LibraryBook
    
- Course → **HELD_IN** → Semester
    

### **Refinement Example**

Add a **Grade** property to the **COMPLETED** relationship:

```
(:Student)-[:COMPLETED {grade: "A+"}]->(:Course)
```

---

# ## 7. Flexibility & Refactoring

- Graph schemas are **optional and dynamic**.
    
- New relationships/properties can be added without breaking the model.
    
- This makes graphs ideal for evolving systems like social networks or learning platforms.

# ## 8. Predictive Modeling — Definition

Predictive Modeling uses:

- **Historical data**
    
- **Machine learning/statistical techniques**
    

To **predict future outcomes**.

### **Goal**

Identify patterns → apply patterns → forecast unknown events.

---

# ## 9. How Predictive Modeling Works

### **Steps**

1. **Train Model**  
    Input historical data (features + output labels).
    
2. **Pattern Learning**  
    Algorithm detects trends and behaviors.
    
3. **Prediction**  
    Apply model to new data to forecast outcomes.

# ## 10. Applications of Predictive Modeling

- **Retail/E-Commerce:**
    
    - Product recommendations
        
    - Churn prediction
        
- **Finance/Banking:**
    
    - Fraud detection
        
    - Credit scoring
        
- **Social Media:**
    
    - Facebook’s "People You May Know"
        

---

# ## 11. Graph + Predictive Modeling Example

### **Telecom Fraud Detection**

- Even if a fraudster repeatedly changes personal details,  
    **their relationship patterns remain similar**.
    
- Graph algorithms detect **relationship patterns**, not just raw values.
    
- Predictive models flag suspicious nodes.
    

---

# ## 12. Summary

- **Graph Data Modeling:**
    
    - Start with schema → test → refine.
        
- **Predictive Modeling:**
    
    - Uses past data + ML to forecast outcomes.
        
- Graph structures capture **connections & behaviors** better than flat relational tables.
