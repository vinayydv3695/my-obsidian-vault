# ⭐ **SECTION 1 — FLASHCARDS
### **Flashcard 1**

**Q:** What is the purpose of enabling authorization in `mongod.cfg`?  
**A:** It enforces role-based access control (RBAC), ensuring only authenticated users can perform operations.

---

### **Flashcard 2**

**Q:** Command to create an admin user with full privileges?  
**A:**

```js
db.createUser({
  user: "admin",
  pwd: passwordPrompt(),
  roles: [
    { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" },
    { role: "readWriteAnyDatabase", db: "admin" }
  ]
})
```

---

### **Flashcard 3**

**Q:** What is the principle of least privilege?  
**A:** Granting users only the permissions needed to perform their tasks.

---

### **Flashcard 4**

**Q:** What encrypts MongoDB network communication?  
**A:** TLS / SSL (Transport Layer Security / Secure Sockets Layer).

---

### **Flashcard 5**

**Q:** What protects MongoDB data stored on disk?  
**A:** Data-at-rest encryption via the WiredTiger encrypted storage engine.

---

### **Flashcard 6**

**Q:** What is Client-Side Field Level Encryption (FLE)?  
**A:** Encrypts specific fields _before_ data reaches MongoDB; only the client can decrypt them.

---

### **Flashcard 7**

**Q:** What are the audit log targets available in MongoDB?  
**A:** Console, Syslog, JSON file, BSON file.

---

### **Flashcard 8**

**Q:** Why must audit logs have total order?  
**A:** To maintain sequential event tracking — requires journaling.

---

### **Flashcard 9**

**Q:** What is the default MongoDB bind IP?  
**A:** `127.0.0.1`

---

### **Flashcard 10**

**Q:** How do you allow external MongoDB connections?  
**A:** Add IPs in `mongod.cfg` under:

```
net:
  bindIp: 127.0.0.1,<other_IP>
```
