## ## 1. Case Study: Grocery Shop Inventory System

A grocery store needs to monitor inventory and alert procurement when stock is low.

### **Steps for Designing in RDBMS**

1. **Identify Actors**
    
    - Buyer
        
    - Employee
        
    - Purchaser
        
    - Supplier
        
    - Supplier Address
        
    - Office Address
        
2. **Define Models / Entities**
    
    - UserProfile
        
    - Department
        
    - Role
        
    - Product
        
    - Supplier
        
    - Supplier Address
        
3. **Define Relationships**  
    Using foreign keys:
    
    - One-to-one
        
    - One-to-many
        
    - Many-to-many
        
4. **Create the Database**
    
    - Tables with fixed schemas
        
    - Links via foreign keys

## ## 2. Challenges of RDBMS in Real-World Growth

1. **Team Challenge**
    
    - When employees leave, newcomers need long onboarding to understand complex schemas.
        
2. **Company Expansion**
    
    - Introducing a website and online ordering requires restructuring.
        
3. **Company Acquisition**
    
    - New data models must be merged → large redesign effort.
        
4. **Company Growth**
    
    - Scaling relational systems becomes difficult.
        
5. **Multiple Vendors**
    
    - Maintaining supply chain relationships complicates schema.
        
6. **Providing APIs to Aggregators**
    
    - RDBMS responds slower for large, variable queries.
        
7. **Using Social Platforms**
    
    - User-generated, unstructured data doesn't fit RDBMS well.

## ## 3. RDBMS vs NoSQL — Comparison

### **1. Schema Flexibility**

- RDBMS: Strict, rigid schema → hard to modify.
    
- NoSQL: Flexible, schema-less → can evolve easily.
    

### **2. Complex Queries**

- RDBMS: Requires complex JOINs.
    
- NoSQL: Related data stored inside a single document → no joins.
    

### **3. Data Updates Across Nodes**

- RDBMS: Heavy, slow, complex for distributed systems.
    
- NoSQL: Designed for distributed updates; easier scaling.
    

### **4. Scalability**

- RDBMS: Vertical scaling (limited).
    
- NoSQL: Horizontal scaling (add more nodes easily).
    

---

## ## 4. Transactional Applications (Banking, ERP, etc.)

**Characteristics:**

- Highly structured data
    
- Strong relationships
    
- Schema remains stable
    
- Requires strong consistency
    
- Access often needs complete rows and joins
    
- Must guarantee correctness
    

**RDBMS is a better fit** for such applications.

---

## ## 5. Web Applications (Social Media, CRM, E-commerce)

**Characteristics:**

- Large volume of data → needs scalability
    
- Users accept slight delays (eventual consistency)
    
- Schema may evolve
    
- Some relationships exist but not critical
    
- Heavy reads/writes
    

**NoSQL is a better fit** for such systems.

---

## ## 6. Application Requirements Summary

**If the application needs:**

- Structured schema
    
- Strict relationships
    
- Rare schema changes
    

→ Use **RDBMS**.

**If the application needs:**

- Ability to change schema over time
    
- Optional relationships handled in application
    
- Large-scale data handling
    

→ Use **NoSQL**.

## ## 7. Real Migration Case Studies

### **Netflix**

- Migrated from **Oracle** to **Cassandra**.
    
- Reason: Handling global users → needs massive scaling + fault tolerance.
    

### **Twitter**

- Uses **MySQL + NoSQL mix**.
    
- NoSQL includes Redis and Cassandra.
    
- Reason: High traffic + caching + distributed writes.
